            American-born Chinese raised in the quiet town of Sharon. Attended Sharon High School and dual enrolled in Massassoit Community College for online college credits my senior year.

            Spent a little time <a href="">gaming</a>, went to the <a href="https://youtu.be/ULjbIMvP6A0?t=55">gym</a> at 5:30 in the morning, and <a href="http://www.sharonsailing.org/2018_School_Movie.html">sailed for varsity</a>. During my summers I taught sailing at the Sharon Recreation Department.
